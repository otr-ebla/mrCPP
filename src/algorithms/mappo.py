"""
Multi-Agent PPO in JAX: centralised critic, parameter-shared feed-forward actor.

The whole rollout is a `lax.scan` over the vectorised environment, so a full
(T steps x E envs) batch is collected in one device call with no Python in the
inner loop. The PPO update is likewise a `lax.scan` over epochs.

Credit assignment is per agent end to end: the environment pays each robot for
its own discoveries, the critic produces an agent-specific V_i(s) from the
agent-centred global map, and GAE runs independently on every (env, agent)
stream. Nothing is averaged across agents, so a robot that free-rides on the
team's coverage sees its own advantage drop.

Shapes
------
obs       : (T, E, N, obs_dim)   — continuous prefix normalised, binary tail raw
gstate    : GlobalState pytree with leading (T, E)
action    : (T, E, N, action_dim)
log_prob  : (T, E, N)
reward    : (T, E, N)           — already multiplied by `reward_scale`
value     : (T, E, N)
term      : (T, E)               — hard termination (collision, completion)
done      : (T, E)               — terminated OR truncated

`term` and `done` are stored as float32 0/1 masks rather than bools: jax-metal
0.1.1 returns all-False for any bool-dtype `lax.scan` output, which would
silently erase every episode boundary from the trajectory (see `rollout`).
