"""Flax actor and critic networks for CTDE.

Actor (decentralised execution): a 1D-CNN compresses the lidar scan, the
embedding is concatenated with odometry, relative neighbours and the binary
local-coverage patch, and a small MLP emits the action distribution. There is
no recurrence: the observation already carries the local coverage state, so a
GRU only added a serial dependency and a hidden state to carry around.

Critic (centralised training): a light 2D-CNN reads the per-agent multi-channel
map [walls, coverage, self, teammates], and the flattened features are
concatenated with the joint kinematic vector before the value head.

Orthogonal initialisers require a QR factorisation, which the Metal backend
does not implement. Callers should evaluate `init` on CPU and transfer the
resulting parameters to the accelerator (see `src.utils.jax_device`).
